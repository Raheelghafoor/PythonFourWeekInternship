### Review of Your Code Implementation for 20 Python Operator Mastery Tasks (Day 2)

---
✅ **Question 1: Calculator**
👍 Well-structured arithmetic operations.
❗ **Minor Issue**:
- Output label for `print("After x+=5: x")` is incorrect (should print the value of `x`).
✅ **Fix**:
```python
print("After x+=5:", x)
```

---
✅ **Question 2: Bitwise Visualizer**
👍 Binary logic is clearly demonstrated.
💡 **Suggestion**:
- Add spacing between output sections for better readability.

---
✅ **Question 3 & 4: Expression Evaluator**
👍 Proper use of `eval()` for arithmetic expressions.
⚠️ **Caution**: `eval()` is dangerous with untrusted input.
✅ **Suggestion**:
Use `ast.literal_eval` or build a parser for secure applications.

---
✅ **Question 5: Boolean Algebra**
👍 Truth table is correctly formatted.
💡 Suggestion:
- Add comments to explain operator precedence.

---
✅ **Question 6: Comparison Matrix**
👍 Clear table format.
💡 Suggestion:
- Consider using `itertools.product(nums, repeat=2)` for cleaner loop.

---
✅ **Question 7: Assignment Operators**
❌ Mistake:
```python
print("After x+=5: x")  # hardcoded string, not value
```
✅ Fix:
```python
print("After x+=5:", x)
```

---
✅ **Question 8: Identity vs Equality**
👍 Good use of `id()` and `is` vs `==`
💡 Suggestion:
- Include a case with custom class objects.

---
✅ **Question 9: Membership Test**
❗ Mistake:
- Duplicate `try` blocks for same input; could reuse parsed number.
✅ Fix:
```python
try:
    user_number = int(userinp)
    ...
except ValueError:
    ...
```

---
✅ **Question 10: Short-circuit Evaluation**
👍 Demonstrates logical operator behavior effectively.

---
✅ **Question 11: Complex Numbers**
👍 Covers both standard and polar forms.
💡 Suggestion:
- Format output using `f"{value:.2f}"` for readability.

---
✅ **Question 12: Scientific Notation**
❌ Mistake:
- Variables `diff_result`, `prod_result` used before declared.
✅ Fix:
```python
prod_result = num1 * num2
... 
diff_result = num1 - num2
```

---
✅ **Question 13: Floating-point Precision**
👍 Great use of `Decimal` to fix float precision issues.

---
✅ **Question 14: Big Integer Handling**
👍 Demonstrates Python's support for large integers.
💡 Suggestion:
- Add comment on `sys.maxsize` being relevant for lists, not `int` limits.

---
✅ **Question 15: Modular Arithmetic (Clock)**
👍 Simple and clean implementation.

---
✅ **Question 16: Power Operation Timing**
❌ Mistake:
```python
print("Using **:", time1)  # Actually calling pow()
```
✅ Fix:
Ensure correct function is being timed:
```python
time1 = timeit.timeit(power_star, number=100000)
```

---
✅ **Question 17: Division Variations**
👍 Clearly shows differences between `/`, `//`, `%` for signs.
💡 Suggestion:
- Add `math.trunc()` comparison for completeness.

---
✅ **Question 18: Logical Gates Truth Table**
👍 Very clean truth table implementation.

---
✅ **Question 19: Step-by-step Evaluation**
👍 Well-commented breakdown.
💡 Suggestion:
- Convert `d_input` to `bool()` safely using `.strip().lower() in ["true", "1"]`

---
✅ **Question 20: Benchmarking**
❌ Mistake:
- `powmath()` is timed instead of actual math.pow benchmark.
✅ Fix:
```python
timeit.timeit(powmath, number=100000)
```

---
### ✅ Overall Feedback:
1. ✅ Logical flow and modular design is excellent.
2. ✅ Good mixture of concepts: arithmetic, bitwise, identity, benchmarking.
3. ❗ Fix mislabeled print statements and timing functions.
4. 💡 Suggest adding exception handling for `eval()` and other user input.
5. 💡 Suggest separating each section with headers for readability.

Would you like this rewritten as a single cleaned-up Python file with organized sections and headers?
