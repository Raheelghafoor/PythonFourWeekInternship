### Review of Python Programming Tasks Implementation

---
✅ **Question 1: Grade Calculator**
👍 Good input validation and percentage calculation
❗ **Minor Issues**:
- The percentage range check (0-100) is redundant since marks can't exceed totalmarks
- Could use f-strings more consistently
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Consider adding a function to calculate percentage to avoid repetition
- Add more descriptive comments for the grading logic

---
✅ **Question 2: Tax Calculator**
👍 Clear implementation of tax slabs using match-case
❗ **Issues**:
- The tax calculation for slab3 and slab4 could be simplified
- No validation for extremely high income values
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Consider using a dictionary to store slab thresholds and rates
- Add upper limit validation for income

---
✅ **Question 3: Loan Eligibility**
👍 Comprehensive condition checking
❗ **Issues**:
- The age validation (0-150) conflicts with eligibility check (21-60)
- Could be more modular with separate validation functions
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Make validation ranges consistent
- Consider using constants for threshold values

---
✅ **Question 4: Insurance Premium**
👍 Good use of percentage adjustments
❗ **Issues**:
- Base premium is hardcoded
- No validation for extremely high ages
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Make base premium configurable
- Add more detailed comments about premium calculation logic

---
✅ **Question 5: Discount Calculator**
👍 Clear discount structure
❗ **Issues**:
- The boundary conditions could be clearer (e.g., 5000 is not included in >5000)
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Use consistent comparison operators
- Consider adding a function to determine discount rate

---
✅ **Question 6: Age Classifier**
👍 Simple and effective
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Could use match-case for cleaner code
- Consider adding more age categories if needed

---
✅ **Question 7: Password Checker**
👍 Comprehensive password strength check
❗ **Issues**:
- Password is shown in clear text during input
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Use getpass for password input
- Add minimum length as a configurable parameter

---
✅ **Question 8: BMI Calculator**
👍 Good health categorization
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Add height validation for realistic values
- Consider adding ideal weight range calculation

---
✅ **Question 9: Time Zone Converter**
👍 Good use of dictionary for time zones
❗ **Issues**:
- Time value validation could be more robust (0-23)
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Add more time zones
- Consider using datetime module for more accurate conversions

---
✅ **Question 10: Weather Advisory**
👍 Comprehensive condition checking
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Could use constants for threshold values
- Consider adding more weather factors

---
✅ **Question 11: Speed Violation**
👍 Clear fine structure
❗ **Issues**:
- Hardcoded speed limit
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Make speed limit configurable
- Add points system in addition to fine

---
✅ **Question 12: Credit Score**
👍 Simple and effective
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Could use match-case for status determination
- Consider adding more granular categories

---
✅ **Question 13: Investment Risk**
👍 Good risk assessment logic
❗ **Issues**:
- Some conditions could be simplified
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Consider using enumerated types for investment types
- Add more investment options

---
✅ **Question 14: Medical Diagnosis**
👍 Good use of symptom checking
❗ **Issues**:
- Could benefit from more specific diagnoses
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Add severity levels for symptoms
- Consider using a dictionary for symptom patterns

---
✅ **Question 15: Smart Home**
👍 Practical automation logic
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Add more devices and conditions
- Consider using time ranges instead of fixed hours

---
✅ **Question 16: E-commerce Calculator**
👍 Detailed invoice breakdown
❗ **Issues**:
- Some hardcoded values
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Make tax rate and shipping fees configurable
- Add more discount tiers

---
✅ **Question 17: Admission Check**
👍 Clear eligibility criteria
💡 **Suggestions**:
- Consider adding waitlist category
- Add more admission paths

---
✅ **Question 18: Employee Evaluation**
👍 Good performance metrics
💡 **Suggestions**:
