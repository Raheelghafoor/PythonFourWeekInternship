### Review of Text Tools & String Analysis Suite (Questions 1–20)

✅ **Question 1: Text Analyzer Suite**
👍 Good:
- Simple and effective analysis using `len()`, `split()`, `splitlines()`
❗ Improvement:
- Strip input lines to prevent accidental empty line count issues
- Add support for punctuation and whitespace counting
💡 Suggestion:
```python
import string
punct_count = sum(1 for c in text if c in string.punctuation)
```

✅ **Question 2: String Manipulation Toolkit**
👍 Good transformations for title, camel, and snake case
❗ Improvement:
- Add handling for non-alphabetic characters and empty input
- Use list comprehensions for cleaner code
💡 Suggestion:
```python
rest_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words_list[1:]]
```

✅ **Question 3: Pattern Matching Engine**
👍 Proper use of `re.finditer()`
❗ Improvement:
- Add try-except for invalid regex input
💡 Suggestion:
```python
try:
    regex_matches = re.finditer(pattern, text)
except re.error:
    print("Invalid regex")
```

✅ **Question 4: Text Statistics Calculator**
👍 Accurate lexical density and average lengths
❗ Improvement:
- Use `re.split` for sentence detection (handle ? and !) instead of just "."
- Optimize word length sum with `sum(len(w) for w in words_list)`

✅ **Question 5: Word Frequency Analyzer**
👍 Proper use of `Counter`
❗ Improvement:
- Add stripping of punctuation before counting
💡 Suggestion:
```python
text = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", text)
```

✅ **Question 6: Sentence Structure Parser**
👍 Good use of regex for sentence splitting
❗ Improvement:
- Add support for multiline input
- Ensure proper sentence classification if punctuation is missing

✅ **Question 7: Caesar Cipher**
👍 Working encode/decode logic
❗ Improvement:
- Improve character handling for large shifts or negative values
- Add upper limit to prevent very large shifts

✅ **Question 8: Language Detection Tool**
👍 Keyword-based detection implemented well
❗ Improvement:
- Normalize accented characters for better detection
- Add scoring weight for frequency

✅ **Question 9: Text Summarizer**
👍 Basic extractive summarization by sentence scoring
❗ Improvement:
- Remove stopwords from scoring to improve result relevance
- Normalize sentence casing before scoring

✅ **Question 10: Keyword Extractor**
👍 Functional keyword filter
❗ Improvement:
- Use `Counter` directly for cleaner code
- Add support for multiple lines and punctuation

✅ **Question 11: Text Formatter**
👍 Uses string methods effectively
❗ Improvement:
- Add error handling for width < text length
- Trim text if longer than width

✅ **Question 12: Character Encoding Converter**
👍 Correct use of encode/decode
❗ Improvement:
- Always wrap `decode()` in try-except
- Warn if characters lost in ASCII

✅ **Question 13: Text Comparison Tool**
👍 Correct use of set operations
❗ Improvement:
- Strip punctuation for more accurate comparisons
- Add line-by-line comparison mode

✅ **Question 14: Spell Checker Basics**
👍 Basic spelling and suggestions via `difflib`
❗ Improvement:
- Add stopword filtering before checking
- Highlight suggestion selection

✅ **Question 15: Grammar Analyzer**
👍 Repeated word and passive detection works
❗ Improvement:
- Use regex for repeated pattern detection
- Flag overuse of passive indicators (e.g., many "was" and "by")

✅ **Question 16: Text Template Engine**
👍 Uses `str.format` effectively
❗ Improvement:
- Add error handling for missing keys
💡 Suggestion:
```python
try:
    result = template.format(**data)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Missing placeholder: {e}")
```

✅ **Question 17: Markdown Processor**
👍 Converts headings and bold/italic
❗ Improvement:
- Use `re.sub()` for cleaner parsing of markdown patterns

✅ **Question 18: CSV Parser**
❌ Mistake:
- Code breaks: `lined` is used incorrectly; should use `liness`
- Header parsing logic is incorrect
💡 Fix:
```python
header_line = liness[0]
data_lines = liness[1:]
```

✅ **Question 19: Log File Analyzer**
👍 Proper extraction using slicing
❗ Improvement:
- Add regex pattern for flexible log format parsing

✅ **Question 20: Config File Parser**
👍 Well-structured parsing with `key=value`
❗ Improvement:
- Skip empty or comment lines
- Warn on duplicates

---

### 🔍 Overall Summary:
- ✅ Functional and correct logic across most tasks
- ❗ Needs improvement in error handling, input sanitization, and formatting edge cases
- 💡 Strong foundation — great for beginner-to-intermediate practice

### 🛠️ Recommendations:
1. Add `try-except` for robustness
2. Use `re` and `string` modules consistently for text cleaning
3. Break code into smaller testable functions
4. Improve user feedback in error scenarios
5. Validate all inputs, especially in loops and conversions
