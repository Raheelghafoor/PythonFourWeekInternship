## ✅ **Advanced Sequence Operations**

---

### ✅ **Question 1: Rotate List Right**

👍 **Good**:

* Correct use of slicing and modulus to handle rotation.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Add input validation to handle empty list (`len(lst) == 0`).

---

### ✅ **Question 2: Filter Valid Unique Items**

👍 **Good**:

* Proper filtering of `None`, negative, and duplicate values.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Use inline conditionals or generator expressions for readability.

---

### ✅ **Question 3: Transform Even/Odd**

👍 **Good**:

* Correct and clean use of modulo logic.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Can be rewritten more concisely using list comprehensions.

---

### ✅ **Question 4: Multiply All Elements**

👍 **Good**:

* Loop-based product implementation is solid.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Add check for empty input (`[]`) which currently returns `1` unexpectedly.

---

### ✅ **Question 5: Zip to Dictionary**

👍 **Good**:

* Manual zipping works, though built-in `zip()` is simpler.

💡 **Suggestion**:

```python
return dict(zip(names, scores))
```

---

## ✅ **Dictionary Operations Deep Dive**

---

### ❌ **Question 1: Even Square Dictionary**

❌ **Mistake**:

* `return` is wrongly indented inside the loop, so only the first match is returned.

❗ **Fix**:

```python
def even_square_dict(numbers):
    result = {}
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            result[num] = num ** 2
    return result  # Moved outside loop
```

---

### ✅ **Question 2: Add or Update Student**

👍 **Good**:

* Proper nesting and update logic.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Add score type validation (must be numeric).

---

### ✅ **Question 3: Merge Dictionaries**

👍 **Good**:

* Smart merge with value conversion to lists.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Also support merging if both values are already lists.

---

### ✅ **Question 4: Validate Required Keys**

👍 **Good**:

* Straightforward key validation logic.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Consider returning missing keys for more debugging info.

---

### ✅ **Question 5: Apply Discount**

👍 **Good**:

* Correct percentage discount with rounding.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Use named constants for discount rate for flexibility.

---

### ✅ **Question 6: Filter Passed Students**

👍 **Good**:

* Accurate filter for scores > 60.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Change `>` to `>=` if 60 should also pass.

---

### ✅ **Question 7: Sort by Score**

👍 **Good**:

* Correct sorting using `lambda` and `items()`.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Return as dictionary (if needed): `dict(sorted(...))`.

---

### ✅ **Question 8: JSON I/O**

👍 **Good**:

* Proper use of `json.dump()` and `load()`.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Wrap in try-except for I/O safety.

---

### ⚠️ **Question 9: Cache Decorator (Not Used)**

❗ **Issue**:

* Decorator is defined but not applied to the function.

❗ **Fix**:

```python
@dict_cache_decorator
def sum_values(data):
    return sum(data.values())
```

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Demonstrate cache hits vs. misses using logs.

---

### ✅ **Question 10: Dict Difference**

👍 **Good**:

* Captures and returns mismatched values clearly.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Also return keys missing from either dict for full comparison.

---

### ✅ **Question 11: Navigate Nested Dictionary**

👍 **Good**:

* Clean traversal of nested paths.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Add support for list indices if needed.

---

### ✅ **Question 12: Flatten Dictionary**

👍 **Good**:

* Correct recursive flattening with dynamic key paths.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Parameterize the separator and support deeper nesting.

---

### ✅ **Question 13: Invert Dictionary**

👍 **Good**:

* Accurately groups keys by value.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Use `defaultdict(list)` for simpler logic.

---

### ✅ **Question 14: Calculate Stats**

👍 **Good**:

* Returns average, min, and max properly.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Return named tuple or dict for clarity.

---

### ✅ **Question 15: Validate Dictionary**

👍 **Good**:

* Checks for string keys, non-`None` values, and uniqueness.

💡 **Suggestion**:

* Return error messages with reasons for invalidation.

---

## ✅ **Overall Recommendations**

1. **Fix Indentation Bugs**: Especially early `return` in `even_square_dict`.
2. **Decorator Usage**: Always apply decorators after defining them.
3. **Enhance Robustness**: Add input type validation and exception handling.
4. **Use Built-ins**: Favor `zip()`, `map()`, `defaultdict`, etc. for readability.
5. **Refactor for Reuse**: Use helper functions for repeated patterns.
